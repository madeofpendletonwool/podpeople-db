<!-- It's meant as a suppliment to the Podcast 2.0 movement <a href="https://podcasting2.org/podcast-namespace/tags/person">person tag</a> that allows podcast to add host and guest data to their feeds. The intention of this project is to act as that source of truth for podcasts that don't yet have that tag. Listeners of the individual podcast submit the data to this site and then it allows podcast apps to fall back to this project to get that person information when podcasts don't otherwise have it.

            <h2>The IMDB of Podcast Hosts</h2>
            
            <p>PodPeopleDB is an open database platform designed to catalog and track podcast hosts and guests across the podcasting ecosystem. Think of it as IMDB, but for podcast personalities instead of actors.</p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Host & Guest Tracking:</strong> Maintain a comprehensive database of podcast hosts and their appearances.</li>
                <li><strong>Podcast Integration:</strong> Automatic parsing of podcast:person tags from podcast feeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Driven:</strong> Allow users to submit and update host information.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Data:</strong> Free access to the database for developers and podcast apps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why PodPeopleDB?</h3>
            <p>The podcasting world lacks a centralized database for tracking hosts and guests across shows. While services exist to track shows and episodes, there's no easy way to follow your favorite hosts across different podcasts or discover where a particular guest has appeared. That said, before some company swoops in and makes a paid version of this app, let's make a great free and open source version!</p>

            <h3>Use Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Track your favorite podcast hosts across different shows</li>
                <li>Discover all podcast appearances by a specific guest</li>
                <li>Build podcast apps with enhanced host/guest discovery features</li>
                <li>Research podcast host networks and connections</li>
            </ul>
